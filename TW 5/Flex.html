            HTML is the foundational building block of web pages, defining their
            structure and content. My HTML courses cover everything from basic
            tags to complex structures, emphasizing the latest features of
            HTML5. Students learn to create accessible, standard-compliant web
            pages that are also SEO-friendly. The training is designed for
            learners at all levels, aiming to thoroughly grasp the fundamentals
            of web development.

          <p>
            SS is a crucial tool for styling and enhancing the aesthetics and
            user experience of web pages. In my courses, students explore
            everything from CSS selectors to advanced animations, layout
            techniques, and responsive design principles. The focus is on modern
            layout systems like Flexbox and Grid, equipping students to create
            clean, effective, and maintainable style sheets. These courses blend
            both theoretical and practical aspects of CSS.

          <h2>REACT</h2>
          <p>
            React, a popular JavaScript library for user interface development,
            is a key focus of my training program. Starting from the basics, the
            courses cover state management, life cycle methods, and creating
            reusable components. I emphasize modern features like React Hooks
            and the Context API, preparing students to develop interactive and
            contemporary web applications. The training is aimed at equipping
            developers with up-to-date React development skills.
